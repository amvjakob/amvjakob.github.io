Hi there!

I'm a visiting graduate student at [Harvard University](http://harvard.edu/)
working with [Sam Gershman](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/samuel-j-gershman), 
with the support of a [Bertarelli Fellowship](https://bertarelli.hms.harvard.edu/).
Concurrently, I am finishing my Master's degree in Computational Neuroscience at
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

The brain has always fascinated me. I am passionate about using diverse statistical
and computational methods to make sense of neural signals and am generally interested 
in deep learning applications for neuroscience. I am also curious about how new 
insights from neuroscience could translate into improvements in the current state
of the art of machine learning models.

If I'm not coding, you might find me at a chess board âš¡, at the gym ðŸšµ
or out hiking ðŸŒ„!
